                        <p>
                            Thank you for choosing Lift Logr. This Privacy
                            Policy outlines how Lift Logr (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
                            collects, uses, and protects the information you
                            provide when you use our mobile application (“the
                            App”).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                        <p>
                            Lift Logr does not collect any personal information
                            from its users. The App operates on a local-only
                            basis, meaning all data input and generated by the
                            user is stored locally on the user's device and
                            never leave the device.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since we do not collect any personal information, we
                            do not use your information in any way. Lift Logr
                            solely operates to assist users in tracking their
                            lifting routines and does not share, sell, or
                            otherwise distribute any information gathered by the
                            App.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Data Security</h3>
                        <p>
                            All data input and generated by the user is stored
                            locally on the user's device; using Apple’s data
                            base framework, Swift Data.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                        <p>
                            We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy
                            Policy at any time. Any changes to the Privacy
                            Policy will be reflected in the updated version of
                            the App, along with the effective date. It is your
                            responsibility to review this Privacy Policy
                            periodically for any changes.
